	abstract = {Multiview videos offer unprecedented experience by allowing
	users to explore scenes from different angles and perspectives. Thus,
	such videos have been gaining substantial interest from major content
	providers such as Google and Facebook. Adaptive streaming of multiview
	videos is, however, challenging because of the Internet dynamics and the
	diversity of user interests and network conditions. To address this
	challenge, we propose a novel rate adaptation algorithm for multiview
	videos (called MASH). Streaming multiview videos is more user centric
	than single-view videos, because it heavily depends on how users
	interact with the different views. To efficiently support this
	interactivity, MASH constructs probabilistic view switching models that
	capture the switching behavior of the user in the current session, as
	well as the aggregate switching behavior across all previous sessions of
	the same video. MASH then utilizes these models to dynamically assign
	relative importance to different views. Furthermore, MASH uses a new
	buffer-based approach to request video segments of various views at
	different qualities, such that the quality of the streamed videos is
	maximized while the network bandwidth is not wasted. We have implemented
	a multiview video player and integrated MASH in it. We compare MASH
	versus the state-of-the-art algorithm used by YouTube for streaming
	multiview videos. Our experimental results show that MASH can produce
	much higher and smoother quality than the algorithm used by YouTube,
	while it is more efficient in using the network bandwidth. In addition,
	we conduct large-scale experiments with up to 100 concurrent multiview
	streaming sessions, and we show that MASH maintains fairness across
	competing sessions, and it does not overload the streaming server.},

	abstract = {HTTP Adaptive Streaming is a successful and largely adopted content delivery technology. Yet poor bandwidth prediction, notably in mobile networks, may cause bit-rate oscillations, increased segment delivery delays, video freezes, and may thus negatively impact the end user quality of experience. To address this issue, we propose to exploit the stream prioritization and termination features of the HTTP/2 protocol to achieve video frame filtering and scheduling, so as to maximize the amount of video data received on time by the client. We evaluate with optimal scheduling and filtering algorithms the maximum gain we may expect from such delivery schemes where video frames are carried in dedicated HTTP/2 streams. Evaluation shows that our HTTP/2-based video frame scheduling scheme brings benefits for video quality.},

	abstract = {Adaptive video streaming over HTTP, such as the MPEG-DASH standard, is now widely used by video service provides to stream their videos to users. But DASH and similar methods are known to suffer from two practical challenges: on the one hand, clients use fixed heuristics that limit their ability to generalize across network conditions, making the clients unable to efficiently predict variations in new networking environments, in turn leading to more buffering. On the other hand, the absence of collaboration among DASH clients leads to unfair bandwidth allocation, and typically pushes the system to an unbalanced equilibrium point. In this paper, we propose a server-side rate adaptation method that significantly improves the fairness of network bandwidth allocation among concurrent DASH users. We formulate the problem as a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP) model, and use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train two neural networks to find an optimal solution to the fairness problem. Since our solution is implemented at the server side, it requires no modifications to the widely-installed DASH clients, making our solution very practical. We show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes in terms of QoE-efficiency, QoE-fairness, and social welfare by as much as 16{\%}, 21{\%}, and 24{\%} respectively.},

	abstract = {Streaming over the wireless channel is challenging due to rapid fluctuations in available throughput. Encouraged by recent advances in cellular throughput prediction based on radio link metrics, we examine the impact on Quality of Experience (QoE) when using prediction within existing algorithms based on the DASH standard. By design, DASH algorithms estimate available throughput at the application level from chunk rates and then apply some averaging function. We investigate alternatives for modifying these algorithms, by providing the algorithms direct predictions in place of estimates or feeding predictions in place of measurement samples. In addition, we explore different prediction horizons going from one to three chunk durations. Furthermore, we induce different levels of error to ideal prediction values to analyse deterioration in user QoE as a function of average error.We find that by applying accurate prediction to three algorithms, user QoE can improve up to 55{\%} depending on the algorithm in use. Furthermore having longer horizon positively affects QoE metrics. Accurate predictions have the most significant impact on stall performance by completely eliminating them. Prediction also improves switching behaviour significantly and longer prediction horizons enable a client to promptly reduce quality and avoid stalls when the throughput drops for a relatively long time that can deplete the buffer. For all algorithms, a 3-chunk horizon strikes the best balance between different QoE metrics and, as a result, achieving highest user QoE. While error-induced predictions significantly lower user QoE in certain situations, on average, they provide 15{\%} improvement over DASH algorithms without any prediction.},

	abstract = {Modern motion camera sensors capture light in discrete frames, a residual artifact from the earliest days of video capture that imposes an unnecessary synchronizing constraint on all pixels (all pixels must start and stop measuring at the same time). While fixed time frames do offer some simplicity -- simpler sensor design, simpler encoding, and simpler transmission -- the rigidity of frames imposes significant costs in terms of dynamic range, precision and sensitivity, and we claim that with advances in hardware and software the time is ripe for a paradigm shift. We present the design of a novel sensor architecture capable of producing a frameless, asynchronous stream of high dynamic range pixel data. The key design insight is to use a high resolution timer to measure the period of time required to gather a per-pixel configurable amount of light rather than the amount of light gathered in a fixed period of time. A system model detailing how such a sensor can be integrated into existing multimedia systems and applications is proposed, exposing a number of interesting challenges with respect to representing and compressing asynchronous pixel data. Results of a preliminary investigation of a baseline scheme that repurposes existing frame synchronous video encoding methods (i.e., H.264) are presented.},

IEEE 802.11 is especially vulnerable to fast movement and change of antenna orientation. When used in UAV networks (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), the network throughput can vary widely and is almost impossible to predict. This paper evaluates an approach originally developed by Kofler for home networks, in a single-hop UAV wireless network setting: the delay between the sending of an IEEE 802.11 packet and the receipt of its corresponding acknowledgment is used as an early indicator of the link quality and as a trigger to adapt (reduce or increase) the video stream's bitrate. Our real-world flight-tests indicate, that this avoids congestion and can frequently avoid the complete loss of video pictures which happens without adaptation.},

To monitor video QoE, we introduce YouSlow that can detect various playback events (e.g., start-up latency, rebufferings and bitrate changes) from video players while a video is being played. Using YouSlow, we have collected more than 400,000 YouTube views from more than 100 countries. We measured the impact of these playback events on video abandonment and found that rebufferings incur abandonment rates six times higher than start-up latency, mostly caused by pre-roll ads. A single rebuffering event has three times the impact of a bitrate change. Even increasing the bitrate can raise abandonment rates by a factor of four compared to keeping the bitrate constant.},

	abstract = {MPEG DASH is a widely used standard for adaptive video streaming over HTTP. The conceptual architecture for DASH includes a web server and clients, which download media segments from the server. Clients select the resolution of video segments by using an Adaptive Bit-Rate (ABR) strategy; in particular, a throughput-based ABR is used in the case of live video applications. However, recent papers show that these strategies may suffer from the presence of proxies/caches in the network, which are instrumental in streaming video on a large scale. To face this issue, we propose to extend the MPEG DASH architecture with a Tracker functionality, enabling client-to-client sharing of control information. This extension paves the way to a novel family of Tracker-assisted strategies that allow a greater design flexibility, while solving the specific issue caused by proxies/caches; in addition, its utility goes beyond the problem at hand, as it can be used by other applications as well, e.g. for peer-to-peer streaming.},

By placing content in caches close to the users, CDNs help increasing the Quality of Experience, e.g., by decreasing the delay until a video playback starts. Existing works on CDN cache performance focus mostly on distinct caching metrics, such as hit rate, given an abstract workload model. Moreover, the nature of the geographical distribution and connection of caches is often oversimplified. In this work, we investigate the performance of cache hierarchies while taking into account the presence of a mixed content workload comprising multiple categories, e.g., news, comedy, and music. We consider the performance of existing caching strategies in terms of cache hit rate and deterioration costs in terms of write operations. Further, we contribute a design and an evaluation of a content category-aware caching strategy, which has the benefit of being sensitive to changing category-specific content popularity. We evaluate our caching strategy, denoted as ACDC (Adaptive Content-Aware Designed Cache), using multiple caching hierarchy models, different cache sizes, and a real world trace covering one week of YouTube requests observed in a large European mobile ISP network. We demonstrate that ACDC increases the cache hit rate for certain hierarchies up to 18.39{\%} and decreases transmission latency up to 12{\%}. Additionally, a decrease in disk write operations up to 55{\%} is observed.},

	abstract = {Stalls during video playback are perhaps the most important indicator of a client's viewing experience. To provide the best possible service, a proactive network operator may therefore want to know the buffer conditions of streaming clients and use this information to help avoid stalls due to empty buffers. However, estimation of clients' buffer conditions is complicated by most streaming services being rate-adaptive, and many of them also encrypted. Rate adaptation reduces the correlation between network throughput and client buffer conditions. Usage of HTTPS prevents operators from observing information related to video chunk requests, such as indications of rate adaptation or other HTTP-level information.This paper presents BUFFEST, a novel classification framework that can be used to classify and predict streaming clients' buffer conditions from both HTTP and HTTPS traffic. To illustrate the tradeoffs between prediction accuracy and the available information used by classifiers, we design and evaluate classifiers of different complexity. At the core of BUFFEST is an event-based buffer emulator module for detailed analysis of clients' buffer levels throughout a streaming session, as well as for automated training and evaluation of online packet-level classifiers. We then present example results using simple threshold-based classifiers and machine learning classifiers that only use TCP/IP packet-level information. Our results are encouraging and show that BUFFEST can distinguish streaming clients with low buffer conditions from clients with significant buffer margin during a session even when HTTPS is used.},

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed an explosion of multimedia traffic carried over the Internet. Video-on-demand and live streaming services are the most dominant services. To ensure growth, many streaming providers have invested considerable time and effort to keep pace with ever-increasing users' demand for better quality and stall abolition. HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) algorithms are at the core of every major streaming provider service. Recent years have seen sustained development in HAS algorithms. Currently, to evaluate their proposed solutions, researchers need to create a framework and numerous state-of-the-art algorithms. Often, these frameworks lack flexibility and scalability, covering only a limited set of scenarios. To fill this gap, in this paper we propose DASHbed, a highly customizable real-time framework for testing HAS algorithms in a wireless environment. Due to its low memory requirement, DASHbed offers a means of running large-scale experiments with a hundred competing players. Finally, we supplement the proposed framework with a dataset consisting of results for five HAS algorithms tested in various evaluated scenarios. The dataset showcases the abilities of DASHbed and presents the adaptation metrics per segment in the generated content (such as switches, buffer-level, P. 1203.1 values, delivery rate, stall duration, etc.), which can be used as a baseline when researchers compare the output of their proposed algorithm against the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

This paper describes an adaptive multimedia and mulsemedia delivery system which employs an extension of DASH to support multiple sensorial media. Testing using a real-life test-bed shows how user satisfaction increases when employing the proposed solution which exposes users to multi-sensorial content. The motivation behind this work is the creation the first solution for remote adaptive multi-sensory media (mulsemedia) content delivery in order to enhance user satisfaction and increase their quality of experience. A DASH-based mulsemedia delivery system (DASH-MS) was built and tested. This work focuses on a fundamental issue for remote multi-sensory media systems: synchronization and shows how the proposed DASH-MS addresses it. Results of real life subjective testing indicate that the average levels of user satisfaction when exposed to content with the mulsemedia effects are better or at least equal to those when no such effects were included. Additionally, the highest value of the level of satisfaction corresponds to the case when these effects were correctly synchronized. Finally, users seem to have preferred effects in advance than late effects.},

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed great success of mobile short-form video apps. However, most current video streaming strategies are designed for long-form videos, which cannot be directly applied to short-form videos. Especially, short-form videos differ in many aspects, such as shorter video length, mobile friendliness, sharp popularity dynamics, and so on. Facing these challenges, in this paper, we perform an in-depth measurement study on Douyin, one of the most popular mobile short-form video platforms in China. The measurement study reveals that Douyin adopts a rather simple strategy (called Next-One strategy) based on HTTP progressive download, which uses a sliding window with stop-and-wait protocol. Such a strategy performs poorly when network connection is slow and user scrolling is fast. The results motivate us to design an intelligent adaptive streaming scheme for mobile short-form videos. We formulate the short-form video streaming problem and propose an adaptive short-form video streaming strategy called LiveClip using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach. Trace-driven experimental results prove that LiveClip outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches by around 10{\%}-40{\%} under various scenarios.},

	abstract = {HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) is the widely adopted solution for video streaming over the Internet. When network throughput is highly variable, designing an optimal HAS solution that maximizes Quality of Experience (QoE) becomes challenging. Each chunk should be prefetched at highest possible quality while rebufferings and quality switches are minimized. Scalable Video Coding (SVC), with its layered encoding of video, provides more flexibility for HAS clients. It can reduce the occurrence of rebufferings under variable network conditions. However, SVC introduces at least 10{\%} overhead on video bitrate per layer and increases the number of HTTP requests to fetch video chunks. So streaming SVC video at high qualities is more expensive. We propose a solutions that employs both SVC and non-SVC video to improve user's QoE while avoiding the increased bandwidth overhead and HTTP signaling of SVC. Our experiments using real-world bandwidth traces show that this method improves QoE compared to the state-of-the-art adaptation methods under various network conditions.},

In comparison, multi-layered video coding such as H.264/SVC provides more flexibility for upgrading the quality of buffered video segments and has the potential to further improve QoE. However, there are two challenges for using SVC in DASH: (i) the complexity in designing ABR algorithms; and (ii) the negative impact of SVC's coding overhead. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning method called Grad for designing ABR algorithms that take advantage of the quality upgrade mechanism of SVC. Additionally, we quantify the impact of coding overhead on the achievable QoE of SVC in DASH, and propose jump-enabled hybrid coding (HYBJ) to mitigate the impact. Through emulation, we demonstrate that Grad-HYBJ, an ABR algorithm for HYBJ learned by Grad, outperforms the best performing state-of-the-art ABR algorithm by 17{\%} in QoE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel space-time video super-resolution method, which aims to recover a high-frame-rate and high-resolution video from its low-frame-rate and low-resolution observation. Existing solutions seldom consider the spatial-temporal correlation and the long-term temporal context simultaneously and thus are limited in the restoration performance. Inspired by the epipolar-plane image used in multi-view computer vision tasks, we first propose the concept of temporal-profile super-resolution to directly exploit the spatial-temporal correlation in the long-term temporal context. Then, we specifically design a feature shuffling module for spatial retargeting and spatial-temporal information fusion, which is followed by a refining module for artifacts alleviation and detail enhancement. Different from existing solutions, our method does not require any explicit or implicit motion estimation, making it lightweight and flexible to handle any number of input frames. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method not only generates superior space-time video super-resolution results but also retains competitive implementation efficiency.},

	abstract = {On-demand video streaming is a popular application which accounts for a large share of today's Internet traffic. Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) is the major streaming technology used by large content providers. However, this technology suffers from performance problems when multiple clients are streaming on shared network links. Aiming at improving the viewers' Quality of Experience, this thesis studies how DASH Assisting Network Elements (DANEs) optimize bottleneck network links and improve DASH streaming performance. The DANE is aware of DASH traffic on the network link, and partitions available network resources between DASH players and other traffic. Two DANE prototypes have been proposed as part of this thesis. In experiments with DASH players in wired and wireless networks, it is shown that the DANEs increase video bitrate, reduce quality switches, and improve fairness between players. Additionally, Markov models have been developed to explore sharing policies for DANEs. The models are used to determine the effect of those policies on streaming performance and to optimize network resource sharing for DASH players. Thorough validations with real DASH players show that the Markov models are highly accurate. In the remaining last year of the PhD program, I will apply DANE technology to cellular (5G) networks and use the Markov models to obtain an optimal sharing strategy.},

In this paper, using data from more than a hundred video publishers spanning two years, we characterize the video management plane and its evolution. The management plane shows significant diversity with respect to video packaging, playback device support, and CDN use, and current trends suggest increasing diversity in some of these dimensions. This diversity adds complexity to management, and we show that the complexity of many management tasks is sub-linearly correlated with the number of hours a publisher's content is viewed. Moreover, today each publisher runs an independent management plane, and this practice can lead to sub-optimal outcomes for syndicated content, such as redundancies in CDN storage and loss of control for content owners over delivery quality.},

Satisfying this objective has so-far proved elusive, due to the inherent system complexities that degrade streaming performance, such as variability in both video bitrate and network conditions. In this paper, we present SAP as a DASH video traffic management solution that reduces playback stalls and seeks to maintain a consistent QoE for cellular users, even those with diverse channel conditions. SAP achieves this by leveraging both network and client state information to optimize the pacing of individual video flows. We extensively evaluate SAP performance using real video content and clients, operating over a simulated LTE network. We implement state-of-the-art client adaptation and traffic management strategies for direct comparison. Our results, using a heavily loaded base station, show that SAP reduces the number of stalls and the average stall duration per session by up to 95{\%}. Additionally, SAP ensures that clients with good channel conditions do not dominate available wireless resources, evidenced by a reduction of up to 40{\%} in the standard deviation of the QoE metric.},

Despite a large number of efforts to enhance user quality of experience (QoE) both at the ingest and distribution side of live video, the fundamental limitations are that streamer's upstream bandwidth and computational capacity limit the quality of experience of thousands of viewers.To overcome this limitation, we design LiveNAS, a new live video ingest framework that enhances the origin stream's quality by leveraging computation at ingest servers. Our ingest server applies neural super-resolution on the original stream, while imposing minimal overhead on ingest clients. LiveNAS employs online learning to maximize the quality gain and dynamically adjusts the resource use to the real-time quality improvement. LiveNAS delivers high-quality live streams up to 4K resolution, outperforming WebRTC by 1.96 dB on average in Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio on real video streams and network traces, which leads to 12{\%}-69{\%} QoE improvement for live stream viewers.},

In this work, we set to investigate how to utilize the new features offered by HTTP/2 for video streaming over the Internet, focusing on the streaming delivery to mobile devices as, today, more and more users watch video on their mobile devices. For this purpose, we design DASH2M, Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP/2 to Mobile Devices. DASH2M deliberately schedules the streaming content delivery by comprehensively considering the user's Quality of Experience (QoE), the dynamics of the network resources, and the power efficiency on the mobile devices.

CDNs must meet users' demands for fast join times, high bitrates, and low buffering ratios, while minimizing their own cost of delivery and responding to issues in real-time. Wide-area latency, loss, and failures, as well as varied workloads ("mega-events" to long-tail), make meeting these demands challenging.An analysis of video sessions concluded that a centralized controller could improve user experience, but CDN systems have shied away from such designs due to the difficulty of quickly handling failures, a requirement of both operators and users. We introduce VDN, a practical approach to a video delivery network that uses a centralized algorithm for live video optimization. VDN provides CDN operators with real-time, fine-grained control. It does this in spite of challenges resulting from the wide-area (e.g., state inconsistency, partitions, failures) by using a hybrid centralized+distributed control plane, increasing average bitrate by 1.7x and decreasing cost by 2x in different scenarios.},

As an alternative, this paper presents a traffic profiling solution to passively estimate parameters of HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) applications at the lower layers. By observing IP packet arrivals, our machine learning system identifies video flows and detects the state of an HAS client's play-back buffer in real time. Our experiments with YouTube's mobile client show that Random Forests achieve very high accuracy even with a strong variation of link quality. Since this high performance is achieved at IP level with a small, generic feature set, our approach requires no Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), comes at low complexity, and does not interfere with end-to-end encryption. Traffic profiling is, thus, a powerful new tool for monitoring and managing even encrypted HAS traffic in mobile networks.},

To improve QoE, HTTP adaptive streaming with various adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms has been massively deployed for video delivery. Based on their required input information, these algorithms can be classified, into buffer-based, throughput-based or hybrid buffer-throughput algorithms. Nowadays, due to their low cost and high scalability, peer-to-peer (P2P) networks have become an efficient alternative for video delivery over the Internet, and many attempts at merging HTTP adaptive streaming and P2P networks have surfaced. However, the impact of merging these two approaches is still not clear enough, and interestingly, the existing HTTP adaptive streaming algorithms lack testing in a P2P environment. In this paper, we address and analyze the main problems raised by the use of the existing HTTP adaptive streaming algorithms in the context of P2P networks. We propose two methodologies to make these algorithms more efficient in P2P networks regardless of the ABR algorithm used, one favoring overall QoE and one favoring P2P efficiency. Additionally, we propose two new metrics to quantify the P2P efficiency for ABR delivery over P2P.},

In HAS, the client requests segments of content using HTTP, with an ABR algorithm selecting the quality at which to request each segment to trade-off video quality with the avoidance of stalling. This introduces significant end to end latency compared to traditional broadcast, due to the the client requiring a large enough buffer for the ABR algorithm to react to changes in network conditions in a timely manner. The recently standardised Common Media Application Format (CMAF) has helped address the issue of latency by defining segments as composed of independently transferable chunks. In this paper, we describe a simulation model we have developed to evaluate the performance of four popular ABR algorithms using DASH and CMAF in various low latency live streaming scenarios. Realistic network conditions are used for the evaluation, which are based on throughput data taken from the CDN logs of a commercial live TV service. We quantify the performance of the ABR algorithms using a selection of QoE metrics, and show that CMAF can significantly improve ABR performance in low delay scenarios.},

The latter is defined as a combination of the decoded quality, the quality fluctuations and the rebuffering events experienced by the user during the playback. To solve this problem, we cast a Markov Decision Process (MDP) optimization for the selection of the optimal representations. System dynamics required in the MDP model are a priori unknown and are therefore learned through a Reinforcement Learning (RL) technique. The developed learning process exploits a parallel learning technique that improves the learning rate and limits sub-optimal choices, leading to a fast and yet accurate learning process that quickly converges to high and stable rewards. Therefore, the efficiency of our controller is not sacrificed for fast convergence. Simulation results show that our algorithm achieves a higher QoE than existing RL algorithms in the literature as well as heuristic solutions, as it is able to increase average QoE and reduce quality fluctuations.},

	abstract = {Bitrate adaptation is critical in ensuring good users' quality-of-experience (QoE) in Internet video delivery system. Several efforts have argued that accurate throughput prediction can dramatically improve (1) initial bitrate selection for low startup delay and high initial resolution; (2) midstream bitrate adaptation for high QoE. However, prior ef- forts did not systematically quantify real-world throughput predictability or develop good prediction algorithms. To bridge this gap, this paper makes three key technical contributions: First, we analyze the throughput characteristics in a dataset with 20M+ sessions. We find: (a) Sessions sharing similar key features (e.g., ISP, region) present similar initial values and dynamical patterns; (b) There is a natural “stateful” dynamical behavior within a given session. Second, building on these insights, we develop CS2P, a better throughput prediction system. CS2P leverages data-driven approach to learn (a) clusters of similar sessions, (b) an initial throughput predictor, and (c) a Hidden-Markov-Model based midstream predictor modeling the stateful evolution of throughput. Third, we develop a prototype system and show by trace-driven simulation and real-world experiments that CS2P outperforms state-of-art by 40{\%} and 50{\%} median pre- diction error respectively for initial and midstream through- put and improves QoE by 14{\%} over buffer-based adaptation algorithm.},

	abstract = {Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) is broadly deployed on the Internet for live and on-demand video streaming services. Recently, a new version of HTTP was proposed, named HTTP/2. One of the objectives of HTTP/2 is to improve the end-user perceived latency compared to HTTP/1.1. HTTP/2 introduces the possibility for the server to push resources to the client. This paper focuses on using the HTTP/2 protocol and the server push feature to reduce the start-up delay in a DASH streaming session. In addition, the paper proposes a new approach for video adaptation, which consists in estimating the bandwidth, using WebSocket (WS) over HTTP/2, and in making partial adaptation on the server side. Obtained results show that, using the server push feature and WebSocket layered over HTTP/2 allow faster loading time and faster convergence to the nominal state. Proposed solution is studied in the context of a direct client-server HTTP/2 connection. Intermediate caches are not considered in this study.},

LD-Tetrys has the following advantages: i) it drastically improves the trade-off between throughput and quality without modifying the codecs or adding complexity at the encoder side ii) it allows a simple but robust configuration. The only cost is a minor modification of the decoding process and a slight increase in the video decoding complexity. Last but not least, LD-Tetrys requires a much smaller playout buffer to obtain the same perceived video quality, bringing benefits for interactive applications.},

We propose a new Adaptation {\&} Buffer Management Algorithm, called ABMA+, which selects video representation based on the predicted probability of video freezing. The algorithm continuously estimates segment download time characteristics and use the pre-computed playout buffer map to select the maximum video representation which guarantee smooth content playout. Our algorithm, thanks to the buffer map, avoids heavy online computation so it could be widely deployed on different terminals.

	abstract = {Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) video streaming is widely used for over-the-top (OTT) video delivery. Recently, streaming providers have been moving towards using Variable Bitrate (VBR) encodings for the video content, spurred by the potential of improving user QoE (Quality of Experience) and reducing network bandwidth requirements compared to Constant Bitrate (CBR) encodings. However VBR introduces new challenges for ABR streaming, whose nature and implications are little understood. We explore these challenges across diverse video genres, encoding technologies, and platforms. We identify distinguishing characteristics of VBR encodings that impact user QoE and should be factored in any ABR adaptation decision. Traditional ABR adaptation strategies designed for the CBR case are not adequate for VBR. We develop novel best practice design principles to guide ABR rate adaptation for VBR encodings. As a proof of concept, we design a novel and practical control-theoretic rate adaptation scheme, CAVA (Control-theoretic Adaption for VBR-based ABR streaming), incorporating these concepts. Extensive evaluations show that CAVA substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art adaptation techniques, validating the importance of these design principles.},

	abstract = {Video streaming has been dominating the mobile bandwidth, and is still expanding drastically. Its tremendous economic benefits have driven the automobile industry to equip vehicles with video streaming capacity. As a result, the new in-cabin Wi-Fi systems have been deployed, enabling each vehicle as a streaming hotspot on the wheels. A built-in Access Point (AP) bridges the communications between Wi-Fi devices inside and cellular networks outside. Distinct advantages offered by this system include a more powerful antenna array to improve multimedia quality, a constant energy source to power the streaming, etc. However, there exist two challenging features that may jeopardize the system performance. (1) The in-cabin Wi-Fi hotspots are mostly deployed on private vehicles, and thus are completely decentralized. (2) Video packets need to be delivered before their deadlines with small delays. Due to these features, existing algorithms may fail to efficiently schedule the in-cabin Wi-Fi video streaming. To fill the gap, we propose the Delay-awaRe dIstributed Video schedulING (DRIVING) framework. Being fully distributed and delay-aware, DRIVING not only increases the streaming goodput, but also reduces the delivery latency and deadline missing ratio. {\%}In order to optimize this new framework, we establish cross-layer analytical models, which help us tune the framework parameters for better performance. In a typical scenario, DRIVING increases the goodput by up to 27.0{\%}, while reducing the queueing delay and the deadline missing ratio by up to 40.0{\%} and 38.4{\%}, respectively.},

This leads to a heterogeneous device landscape with varying demands. Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) offers an elegant solution to these demands. Smart adaptation logics are able to adjust the clients' streaming quality according to several (local) parameters. Recent research indicated benefits of blending Scalable Video Coding (SVC) with DASH, especially considering Future Internet architectures. However, except for a DASH dataset with a single SVC encoded video, no other datasets are publicly available. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, a DASH/SVC dataset, containing multiple videos at varying bitrates and spatial resolutions including 1080p, is presented. Second, a toolchain for multiplexing SVC encoded videos is provided, therefore making our results reproducible and allowing researchers to generate their own datasets.},

	abstract = {Empowered by today's rich tools for media generation and distribution, and the convenient Internet access, crowdsourced streaming generalizes the single-source streaming paradigm by including massive contributors for a video channel. It calls a joint optimization along the path from crowdsourcers, through streaming servers, to the end-users to minimize the overall latency. The dynamics of the video sources, together with the globalized request demands and the high computation demand from each sourcer, make crowdsourced live streaming challenging even with powerful support from modern cloud computing. In this paper, we present a generic framework that facilitates a cost-effective cloud service for crowdsourced live streaming. Through adaptively leasing, the cloud servers can be provisioned in a fine granularity to accommodate geo-distributed video crowdsourcers. We present an optimal solution to deal with service migration among cloud instances of diverse lease prices. It also addresses the location impact to the streaming quality. To understand the performance of the proposed strategies in the realworld, we have built a prototype system running over the planetlab and the Amazon/Microsoft Cloud. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the effectiveness of our solution in terms of deployment cost and streaming quality.},

A pointcloud representation is suitable for real-time applications like video conferencing, due to its low-complexity and because it does not need a time consuming reconstruction process. As transport protocol we selected low latency DASH, due to its popularity and client-based adaptation mechanisms for tiling.

	abstract = {Although HTTP-based video streaming can easily penetrate firewalls and profit from Web caches, the underlying TCP may introduce large delays in case of a sudden capacity loss. To avoid an interruption of the video stream in such cases we propose the Backward-Shifted Coding (BSC). Based on Scalable Video Coding (SVC), BSC adds a time-shifted layer of redundancy to the video stream such that future frames are downloaded at any instant. This pre-fetched content maintains a fluent video stream even under highly variant network conditions and leads to high Quality of Experience (QoE). We characterize this QoE gain by analyzing initial buffering time, re-buffering time and content resolution using the Ballot theorem. The probability generating functions of the playback interruption and of the initial buffering latency are provided in closed form. We further compute the quasi-stationary distribution of the video quality, in order to compute the average quality, as well as temporal variability in video quality. Employing these analytic results to optimize QoE shows interesting trade-offs and video streaming at outstanding fluency.},

Rather, today's mobile video streaming are excessively tailored for visual quality, imposing a heavy burden on user's data budget. In this paper, we aim to optimize mobile video streaming of low bitrate efficiency with considering human visual acuity, i.e., preferably avoid sacrificing viewing quality. First, we conduct to in-depth analysis of mobile HTTP adaptive video streaming with a focus not only on how it works, but also on the significance of bitrate saving. Second, we identify a novel research problem on excessive visual quality which leads to bitrate-inefficient video streaming, and propose a flexible system called EyeTube to address it. Specifically, we apply dynamic resolution scaling on mobile video streaming to trade off the bitrate efficiency and user viewing experience Third, we derive general principles for achieving bitrate-efficient mobile video streaming, and employ the principles to an open source web browser, i.e., Chromium, to verify its applicability. An end-to-end EyeTube system is implemented on Samsung smartphones, and the efficiency are evaluated against 10 popular YouTube videos. Experimental results show that all the bitrates of the 10 videos can be reduced by at least 54.2{\%} on average and up to 90.9{\%} at most when the resolution is quartered.

Similar to stalling, these variations in bit rate quality have a negative impact on the users' Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper, we use a trace from a large-scale CDN to show that such quality changes occur in a significant amount of streaming sessions and investigate an ABR video segment retransmission approach to reduce the number of such quality changes. As the new HTTP/2 standard is becoming increasingly popular, we also see an increase in the usage of QUIC as an alternative protocol for the transmission of web traffic including video streaming. Using various network conditions, we conduct a systematic comparison of existing transport layer approaches for HTTP/2 that is best suited for ABR segment retransmissions. Since it is well known that both protocols provide a series of improvements over HTTP/1.1, we perform experiments both in controlled environments and over transcontinental links in the Internet and find that these benefits also "trickle up'' into the application layer when it comes to ABR video streaming where QUIC retransmissions can significantly improve the average quality bitrate while simultaneously minimizing bit rate variations over the duration of a streaming session.},

However, existing video rate adaptation is rather limited due to a small number of rate choices, which results in (i) under-selection, (ii) rate fluctuation, and (iii) frequent rebuffering. Moreover, selecting a single video rate for a 360° video can be even more limiting, since not all portions of a video frame are equally important. To address these limitations, we identify new dimensions to adapt user QoE - dropping video frames, slowing down video play rate, and adapting different portions in 360° videos. These new dimensions along with rate adaptation give us a more fine-grained adaptation and significantly improve user QoE. We further develop a simple yet effective learning strategy to automatically adapt the buffer reservation to avoid performance degradation beyond optimization horizon. We implement our approach Favor in VLC, a well known open source media player, and demonstrate that Favor on average out-performs Model Predictive Control (MPC), rate-based, and buffer-based adaptation for regular videos by 24{\%}, 36{\%}, and 41{\%}, respectively, and 2X for 360° videos.},

	abstract = {Mobile environments are characterized by rapidly fluctuating bandwidth and intermittent connectivity. Existing video streaming algorithms can perform poorly in such network conditions because of their reactive adaptation approach. Recent efforts suggest that bitrate adaptation using proactive accurate bandwidth prediction can help improve the quality of experience (QoE) of video streaming. However, highly accurate long-term predictions may be needed in mobile environments and those can be difficult to obtain. In this work, we examine the impact of bandwidth prediction quality on the QoE. We first characterize bandwidth profiles where bandwidth prediction-based adaptation can be useful. We then study the impact of prediction horizon and errors on the performance of Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) streaming. We observe that performance improves as the prediction horizon increases at first and then benefits start to diminish. We demonstrate that with proper error mitigation heuristic, even erroneous predictions can be useful in some scenarios. Finally, we study the role of video system parameters, namely buffer size and bitrate granularity on bandwidth prediction-based adaptation.},

In this paper, we focus on predicting the perceptual quality of videos distorted by noise. Existing video quality metrics are tuned for "white", i.e., spatially uncorrelated noise. However, white noise is very rare in real videos. Based on our analysis of the noise correlation patterns in a broad and comprehensive video set, we build a video database that simulates the commonly encountered noise characteristics. Using the database, we develop a perceptual quality assessment algorithm that explicitly incorporates the noise correlations. Experimental results show that, for videos with spatially correlated noises, the proposed algorithm presents high accuracy in predicting perceptual qualities.},

	abstract = {DASH, or Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP, relies on a rate adaptation component to decide on which representation to download for each video segment. A plethora of rate adaptation algorithms has been proposed in recent years. The decisions of which bitrate to download made by these algorithms largely depend on several factors: estimated network throughput, buffer occupancy, and buffer capacity. Yet, these algorithms are not informed by a fundamental relationship between these factors and the chosen bitrate, and as a result, we found that they do not perform consistently in all scenarios, and require parameter tuning to work well under different buffer capacity. In this paper, we model a DASH client as an M/D/1/K queue, which allows us to calculate the expected buffer occupancy given a bitrate choice, network throughput, and buffer capacity. Using this model, we propose QUETRA, a simple rate adaptation algorithm. We evaluated QUETRA under a diverse set of scenarios and found that, despite its simplicity, it leads to better quality of experience (7{\%} - 140{\%}) than existing algorithms.},

These devices are envisioned to be a heterogeneous mixture of licensed (Tier-1 and Tier-2) and unlicensed, opportunistic devices (Tier-3). The hierarchy in accessing the channel calls for superior adaptation of Tier-3 devices with varying spectral opportunity. While policies are being ratified for efficient sharing, it also calls for redesigning many common applications to adapt to this novel paradigm. In this paper, we focus on the ever-increasing demand for video streaming and present a methodology suitable for Tier-3 devices in the shared access model. Our analysis begins with a stress test of commonly adopted video streaming methods under the new sharing model. This is followed by the design of a robust MDP-based solution that proactively adapts to fast-varying channel conditions, providing better user quality of experience when compared to existing solutions, such as MPEG-DASH. We evaluate our solution on an experimental testbed and find that our MDP-based algorithm outperforms DASH, and partial information of Tier-2 dynamics improves video quality.},

In this work we design, implement and evaluate a novel architecture (denoted SABR) that leverages the benefits of SDN to provide network assisted Adaptive Bitrate Streaming. With clients retaining full control of their streaming algorithms we clearly show that by this network assistance, both the clients and the content providers benefit significantly in terms of QoE and content origin offloading. SABR utilizes information on available bandwidths per link and network cache contents to guide video streaming clients with the goal of improving the viewer's QoE. In addition, SABR uses SDN capabilities to dynamically program flows to optimize the utilization of CDN caches.; AB@Backed by our study of SDN assisted streaming we discuss the change in the requirements for network-to-player APIs that enables flexible video streaming. We illustrate the difficulty of the problem and the impact of SDN-assisted streaming on QoE metrics using various well established player algorithms. We evaluate SABR together with state-of-the-art DASH quality adaptation algorithms through a series of experiments performed on a real-world, SDN-enabled testbed network with minimal modifications to an existing DASH client. Our measurements show the substantial improvement in cache hitrates in conjunction with SABR indicating a rich design space for jointly optimized SDN-assisted caching architectures for video streaming applications.},

Downloading and watching video content on mobile devices is currently a growing trend among users, that is causing a demand for higher bandwidth and better provisioning throughout the network infrastructure. At the same time, popular demand for privacy has led many online streaming services to adopt end-to-end encryption, leaving providers with only a handful of indicators for identifying QoE issues.In order to address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology for detecting video streaming QoE issues from encrypted traffic. We develop predictive models for detecting different levels of QoE degradation that is caused by three key influence factors, i.e. stalling, the average video quality and the quality variations. The models are then evaluated on the production network of a large scale mobile operator, where we show that despite encryption our methodology is able to accurately detect QoE problems with 72{\%}-92{\%} accuracy, while even higher performance is achieved when dealing with cleartext traffic},

This paper presents two open-source software tools that contribute to these key needs. The first tool is able to measure and register resources consumption metrics for any Windows program (i.e. process id), like the CPU, GPU and RAM usage. Unlike the Task Manager, which requires manual visual inspection for just a subset of these metrics, the developed tool runs on top of the Powershell to periodically measure these metrics, calculate statistics, and register them in log files. The second tool is able to measure QoS metrics from DASH streaming sessions by running on top of TShark, if a non-secure HTTP connection is used. For each DASH chunk, the tool registers: the round-trip time from request to download, the number of TCP segments and bytes, the effective bandwidth, the selected DASH representation, and the associated parameters in the MPD (e.g., resolution, bitrate). It also registers the MPD and the total amount of downloaded frames and bytes. The advantage of this second tool is that these metrics can be registered regardless of the player used, even from a device connected to the same network than the DASH player.},

	abstract = {HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) is being adopted with increasing frequency and becoming the de-facto standard for video streaming. However, the client-driven, on-off adaptation behavior of HAS results in uneven bandwidth competition and this is exacerbated when a large number of clients share the same bottleneck network link and compete for the available bandwidth. With HAS each client independently strives to maximize its individual share of the available bandwidth, which leads to bandwidth competition and a decrease in end-user quality of experience (QoE). The competition causes scalability issues, which are quality instability, unfair bandwidth sharing and network resource underutilization. We propose a new software defined networking (SDN) based dynamic resource allocation and management architecture for HAS systems, which aims to alleviate these scalability issues and improve the per-client QoE. Our architecture manages and allocates the network resources dynamically for each client based on its expected QoE. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture significantly enhances scalability by improving per-client QoE by at least 30{\%} and supporting up to 80{\%} more clients with the same QoE compared to the conventional schemes.},

Intuitively, the heterogeneity of the streaming environment and the underlying technologies lead many of the developed approaches to possess clear performance affinities denoted here as sweet spots. We observe, however, that systematic comparisons of these algorithms are usually conducted within homogeneous player environments.In this work, we show the substantial impact of player choice and configuration on the streaming performance. To this end, we systematically examine three established open-source DASH players, i.e., DASH.JS, Google's Shaka Player, and AStream, that implement fundamentally different configurations featuring various adaptation algorithms. By establishing a large scale emulation framework we (i) extract player sweet spots and (ii) achieve a direct, reproducible comparison of real-world DASH players and algorithms. We present empirical evidence demonstrating that an isolated analysis of DASH player modules is insufficient to capture the player streaming performance.

	abstract = {Recent advances in quality adaptation algorithms leave adaptive bitrate (ABR) streaming architectures at a cross-roads: When determining the sustainable video quality one may either rely on the information gathered at the client vantage point or on server and network assistance. The fundamental problem here is to determine how valuable either information is for the adaptation decision. This problem becomes particularly hard in future Internet settings such as Named Data Networking (NDN) where the notion of a network connection does not exist. In this paper, we provide a fresh view on ABR quality adaptation for QoE maximization, which we formalize as a decision problem under uncertainty, and for which we contribute a sparse Bayesian contextual bandit algorithm denoted CBA. This allows taking high-dimensional streaming context information, including client-measured variables and network assistance, to find online the most valuable information for the quality adaptation. Since sparse Bayesian estimation is computationally expensive, we develop a fast new inference scheme to support online video adaptation. We perform an extensive evaluation of our adaptation algorithm in the particularly challenging setting of NDN, where we use an emulation testbed to demonstrate the efficacy of CBA compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Live streaming service providers can combine adaptive streaming technologies and cloud computing to satisfy this demand. In this paper, we study the problem of preparing live video streams for delivery using cloud computing infrastructure, e.g., how many representations to use and the corresponding parameters (resolution and bit-rate). We present an integer linear program (ILP) to maximize the average user quality of experience (QoE) and a heuristic algorithm that can scale to large number of videos and users. We also introduce two new datasets: one characterizing a popular live streaming provider (Twitch) and another characterizing the computing resources needed to transcode a video. They are used to set up realistic test scenarios. We compare the performance of the optimal ILP solution with current industry standards, showing that the latter are sub-optimal. The solution of the ILP also shows the importance of the type of video on the optimal streaming preparation. By taking advantage of this, the proposed heuristic can efficiently satisfy a time varying demand with an almost constant amount of computing resources.},

Factors such as the Technical Quality (TQ) which covers the technical aspects of the signal quality can be controlled from the network provider. On the other hand, the network provider has no control on the subject's level of interest in a video, the Content Quality (CQ). Together TQ and CQ influence the Overall eXperience (OX) of the subject and, in the case of Over The Top (OTT) video, in a video session. In this paper, we present results from a user subjective study in which the impact of TQ and OX on the acceptability was investigated for OTT video sessions. To minimize the CQ impact on OX, the videos were carefully selected to have relatively neutral content. We assess the impact of TQ and OX on acceptability for videos containing impairment and failure events during lifecycle, thus affecting Accessibility, Retainability and Integrity.

	abstract = {HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) techniques are now the dominant solution for video delivery in mobile networks. Over the past few years, several HAS algorithms have been introduced in order to improve user quality-of-experience (QoE) by bit-rate adaptation. Their difference is mainly the required input information, ranging from network characteristics to application-layer parameters such as the playback buffer. Interestingly, despite the recent outburst in scientific papers on the topic, a comprehensive comparative study of the main algorithm classes is still missing. In this paper we provide such comparison by evaluating the performance of the state-of-the-art HAS algorithms per class, based on data from field measurements. We provide a systematic study of the main QoE factors and the impact of the target buffer level We conclude that this target buffer level is a critical classifier for the studied HAS algorithms. While buffer-based algorithms show superior QoE in most of the cases, their performance may differ at the low target buffer levels of live streaming services. Overall, we believe that our findings provide valuable insight for the design and choice of HAS algorithms according to networks conditions and service requirements.},

Researchers have since developed various novel streaming algorithms such as rate-adaptive streaming to improve the performance of mobile streaming services. However, selection or optimization of streaming algorithms is far from trivial and there is no systematic way to incorporate the tradeoffs between various performance metrics. This work aims at attacking the heart of the problem by developing a novel framework called Post Streaming Quality Analysis (PSQA) to automatically tune any streaming algorithms to maximize a given quality-of-experience (QoE) objective. We show that PSQA not only can be applied to optimize the performance of existing streaming algorithms, but also opens a new way for the exploration of new adaptive video streaming protocols and QoE metrics. Simulation results based on real network throughput traces show that PSQA can optimize existing and new streaming algorithms to achieve QoE that is remarkably close to the optimal achieved using brute-force method ex post facto.},

To achieve a high quality of experience, bitrate adaptation algorithm is required to strike a balance between response agility and video quality stability. Existing online algorithms select bitrates according to instantaneous throughput and buffer occupancy, achieving an agile reaction to changes but inducing video quality fluctuations due to the high dynamic of reference signals. In this paper, the idea of multi-step prediction is proposed to guide a better tradeoff, and the bitrate selection is formulated as a predictive control problem. With it, a generalized predictive control based approach is developed to calculate the optimal bitrate by minimizing the cost function over a moving look-ahead horizon. Finally, the proposed algorithm is implemented on a reference video player with performance evaluations conducted using realistic bandwidth traces. Experimental results show that the multi-step predictive control adaptation algorithm can achieve zero rebuffer event and 63.3{\%} of reduction in bitrate switch.},

However, existing approaches mostly rely on network traffic analysis. In addition to potential accuracy issues, they are challenged by the increasing use of end-to-end network traffic encryption. In this paper, we explore a very different approach to QoE measurement --- utilizing the screen recording capability widely available on commodity devices to record the video displayed on the mobile device screen, and analyzing the recorded video to measure the delivered QoE. We design a novel system VideoEye to conduct such screen-recording-based QoE analysis. We identify the various technical challenges involved, including distortions introduced by the screen recording process that can make such analysis difficult. We develop techniques to accurately measure video QoE from the screen recordings even in the presence of recording distortions. Our evaluations demonstrate that VideoEye accurately detects important QoE indicators including the track played at different points in time, and stall statistics. The maximal error in detected stall duration is 0.5 s. The accuracy of detecting the displayed tracks is higher than 97{\%}.},

At present, several content providers like Netflix, YouTube and Hulu, to name a few, already offer videos that can be streamed with a dynamic video quality. In this work we study the tradeoff of the video length to be downloaded, called segment size, and show the differences in terms of playback quality and reduced buffer outages. We then propose an algorithm able to exploit the network conditions, and adaptively select the video segment size to be downloaded. We analyze the benefits of our proposal in terms of increased playback quality and reduced buffer outages against classic fixed segment size solutions. Our result show that dynamically adapting the segment size can reduce buffer outages, while also increasing the quality streamed.},

	abstract = {Modern video streaming uses adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms than run inside video players and continually adjust the quality (i.e., bitrate) of the video segments that are downloaded and rendered to the user. To maximize the quality-of-experience of the user, ABR algorithms must stream at a high bitrate with low rebuffering and low bitrate oscillations. Further, a good ABR algorithm is responsive to user and network events and can be used in demanding scenarios such as low-latency live streaming. Recent research papers provide an abundance of ABR algorithms, but fall short on many of the above real-world requirements.We develop Sabre, an open-source publicly-available simulation tool that enables fast and accurate simulation of adaptive streaming environments. We used Sabre to design and evaluate BOLA-E and DYNAMIC, two novel ABR algorithms. We also developed a FAST SWITCHING algorithm that can replace segments that have already been downloaded with higher-bitrate (thus higher-quality) segments. The new algorithms provide higher QoE to the user in terms of higher bitrate, fewer rebuffers, and lesser bitrate oscillations. In addition, these algorithms react faster to user events such as startup and seek, and respond more quickly to network events such as improvements in throughput. Further, they perform very well for live streams that require low latency, a challenging scenario for ABR algorithms. Overall, our algorithms offer superior video QoE and responsiveness for real-life adaptive video streaming, in comparison to the state-of-the-art. Importantly all three algorithms presented in this paper are now part of the official DASH reference player dash.js and are being used by video providers in production environments. While our evaluation and implementation are focused on the DASH environment, our algorithms are equally applicable to other adaptive streaming formats such as Apple HLS.},

While coordination among the players, as opposed to all being selfish, has its merits and may alleviate some of these issues. A fully distributed architecture is still desirable in many deployments and better reflects the design spirit of HAS. In this study, we focus on and propose a distributed bitrate adaptation scheme for HAS that borrows ideas from consensus and game theory frameworks. Experimental results show that the proposed distributed approach provides significant improvements in terms of viewer experience, presentation quality stability, fairness and network utilization, without using any explicit communication between the players.},

	abstract = {In search of scalable solutions, CDNs are exploring P2P support. However, the benefits of peer assistance can be limited by various obstacle factors such as ISP friendliness - requiring peers to be within the same ISP, bitrate stratification - the need to match peers with others needing similar bitrate, and partial participation - some peers choosing not to redistribute content. This work relates potential gains from peer assistance to the average number of users in a swarm, its capacity, and empirically studies the effects of these obstacle factors at scale, using a month-long trace of over 2 million users in London accessing BBC shows online. Results indicate that even when P2P swarms are localised within ISPs, up to 88{\%} of traffic can be saved. Surprisingly, bitrate stratification results in 2 large sub-swarms and does not significantly affect savings. However, partial participation, and the need for a minimum swarm size do affect gains. We investigate improvements to gain from increasing content availability through two well-studied techniques: content bundling-combining multiple items to increase availability, and historical caching of previously watched items. Bundling proves ineffective as increased server traffic from larger bundles outweighs benefits of availability, but simple caching can considerably boost traffic gains from peer assistance.},

How successful these efforts and investments are, is a question that needs precise measurements of the results of those technological advancements. HTTP-based Adaptive Streaming (HAS) algorithms, which seek to improve video streaming over the Internet, introduce video bitrate adaptivity in a way that is scalable and efficient. However, how each HAS implementation takes into account the wide spectrum of variables and configuration options, brings a high complexity to the task of measuring the results and visualizing the statistics of the performance and quality of experience. In this paper, we introduce CAdViSE, our Cloud-based Adaptive Video Streaming Evaluation framework for the automated testing of adaptive media players. The paper aims to demonstrate a test environment which can be instantiated in a cloud infrastructure, examines multiple media players with different network attributes at defined points of the experiment time, and finally concludes the evaluation with visualized statistics and insights into the results.},

	abstract = {Video streaming traffic is rapidly growing in mobile networks. Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are expected to keep up with this growing demand, while maintaining a high video Quality of Experience (QoE). This makes it critical for MNOs to have a solid understanding of users' video QoE with a goal to help with network planning, provisioning and traffic management. However, designing a system to measure video QoE has several challenges: i) large scale of video traffic data and diversity of video streaming services, ii) cross-layer constraints due to complex cellular network architecture, and iii) extracting QoE metrics from network traffic. In this paper, we present VideoNOC, a prototype of a flexible and scalable platform to infer objective video QoE metrics (e.g., bitrate, rebuffering) for MNOs. We describe the design and architecture of VideoNOC, and outline the methodology to generate a novel data source for fine-grained video QoE monitoring. We then demonstrate some of the use cases of such a monitoring system. VideoNOC reveals video demand across the entire network, provides valuable insights on a number of design choices by content providers (e.g., OS-dependent performance, video player parameters like buffer size, range of encoding bitrates, etc.) and helps analyze the impact of network conditions on video QoE (e.g., mobility and high demand).},

	abstract = {This paper introduces research that addresses the subjective assessment of Quality of Experience (QoE) during the entire life cycle of a video session. We define a video session life cycle as the time from when a user attempts to initiate playback, until such time that the video ends either from normal video conclusion or through a network-induced failure. We provide a detailed description of our assessment methodology designed to discern whether a user's QoE would be impacted by the presence of failures. To accomphsh this, we carefully select various test conditions to take into consideration the rating scale used, the types of impairments and failures seen by the user, and whether impaired videos are seen together with failed videos in multi-video sessions. The selection and creation of source video sequences are also discussed, as well as the use of between-subjects and within-subjects approaches for running our experiments in a controlled laboratory setting. Statistical analysis was carried out to interpret our experimental results. We compared the results of the between-subjects measures and the results of the within-subjects measures, and concluded that the introduction of a scale with an extended lower bound enabled subjects to more clearly express their dissatisfaction of videos with failures when compared to the traditional ITU 5-point rating scale. In addition, we observed that videos that were simply impaired but concluded normally did not have a statistically significant difference when an extended scale was used.},

	abstract = {Time synchronisation plays a critical role in time-sensitive distributed applications. While a variety of such applications exist across many domains, one particular set of applications where improved time synchronisation can lead to significant benefits, particularly with respect to QoE (Quality of Experience), is multimedia applications. While time synchronisation is not a new challenge, advances in wireless technologies have drastically transformed network infrastructures. 802.11 wireless networks increasingly represent the last hop within the ever expanding Internet and whilst users expect the same levels of multimedia QoE as exist over wired networks, the reality of moving back to contention based access leaves many disappointed. This transformation of networks has also proven problematic for time synchronisation protocols that were designed for wired infrastructures. Wireless networks, particularly contention based networks, can be the source of very significant non-deterministic packet latencies. In certain scenarios, such latencies can greatly degrade the performance of time synchronisation. This work details and validates a technique that can be used to determine the latency of time messages in real-time as they traverse an 802.11 wireless link. Knowledge of these latencies can be used to greatly reduce the error in a dataset employed by time synchronisation protocols such as NTP and, thus, improve their performance. Experimental results confirm error reductions of up to 90{\%} in a dataset and prove that the use of this technique can deliver time accuracies akin to those achievable over wired networks. This in turn can greatly benefit users by enabling multimedia applications to benefit from the continued use of time synchronisation for QoE management. We outline two such scenarios, one where time synchronisation is used to prioritise VoIP traffic within an Access Point and a second where the aim is to use time synchronisation to optimise jitter buffer strategies for WebRTC.},

	abstract = {Internet traffic reports show that YouTube is one of the major sources of data traffic world-wide. Furthermore, the data traffic shifts from mostly fixed landlines to cellular data connections where bandwidth is sparse and expensive. Previous studies revealed that YouTube uses a user-friendly HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) strategy which sacrifices bandwidth efficiency to increase the average playback quality for the user. That way, it happens that the same video segment is transmitted in two or more quality levels, but only one can be shown to the user. We denote this as redundant traffic and this work is dedicated to understanding the influence factors on the amount of redundant traffic. This paper presents the results of a large-scale study with over 12,000 video views over a bottleneck link shaped to various bandwidths. We first evaluate the playback characteristics and show that YouTube's HAS algorithm linearly increases the average playback quality with the available bandwidth while at the same time video buffering is sub-linearly decreased. Furthermore, we identify video-dependent bandwidths which optimize the playback time on a quality level. Afterward, we show that this is achieved by discarding lower layer segments and therefore paid with redundant traffic of up to 40 {\%}. We evaluate the overall efficiency of the system and show that YouTube is able to improve the average quality level by up to 0.7 quality levels by using this adaptation strategy. However, a penalty of 0.5 quality levels is paid for it due to the discarded data of the lower quality segments.},

Though performant in most on-demand scenarios, it is bound by the semantics of TCP, with reliability prioritised over timeliness, even for live video where the reverse may be desired. In this paper, we present an implementation of MPEG-DASH over TCP Hollywood, a widely deployable TCP variant for latency sensitive applications. Out-of-order delivery in TCP Hollywood allows the client to measure, adapt and request the next video chunk even when the current one is only partially downloaded. Furthermore, the ability to skip frames, enabled by multi-streaming and out-of-order delivery, adds resilience against stalling for any delayed messages. We observed that in high latency and high loss networks, TCP Hollywood significantly lowers the possibility of stall events and also supports better quality downloads in comparison to standard TCP, with minimal changes to current adaptation algorithms.},

	abstract = {Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) is a simple, but effective, technology for video streaming over the Internet. It provides adaptive streaming while being highly scalable at the side of the content providers. However, the mismatch between TCP and the adaptive bursty nature of DASH traffic results in underperformance of DASH streams in busy networks. This paper describes a networking architecture based on the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm. Controllers in the network with a broad overview on the network activity provide two mechanisms for adaptation assistance: explicitly signaling target bitrates to DASH players and dynamic traffic control in the network. We evaluate how each of these mechanisms can contribute to the delivery of a stable and high quality stream. It shows that our architecture improves the quality of experience by doubling the video bitrate and reducing disturbing quality switches. As such, this paper contributes insights on how to implement DASH-aware networking that also enables internet service providers, network administrators, and end-users to configure their networks to their requirements.},

	abstract = {Smartphones have recently become a popular platform for deploying the computation-intensive virtual reality (VR) applications, such as immersive video streaming (a.k.a., 360-degree video streaming). One specific challenge involving the smartphone-based head mounted display (HMD) is to reduce the potentially huge power consumption caused by the immersive video. To address this challenge, we first conduct an empirical power measurement study on a typical smartphone immersive streaming system, which identifies the major power consumption sources. Then, we develop QuRate, a quality-aware and user-centric frame rate adaptation mechanism to tackle the power consumption issue in immersive video streaming. QuRate optimizes the immersive video power consumption by modeling the correlation between the perceivable video quality and the user behavior. Specifically, QuRate builds on top of the user's reduced level of concentration on the video frames during view switching and dynamically adjusts the frame rate without impacting the perceivable video quality. We evaluate QuRate with a comprehensive set of experiments involving 5 smartphones, 21 users, and 6 immersive videos using empirical user head movement traces. Our experimental results demonstrate that QuRate is capable of extending the smartphone battery life by up to 1.24X while maintaining the perceivable video quality during immersive video streaming. Also, we conduct an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved subjective user study to further validate the minimum video quality impact caused by QuRate.},

	abstract = {Enhancing user experience in streaming applications is an important problem. Delivering the best quality possible for the given network conditions is not an easy task. In the case of a streaming client running in a multi-homed network, this problem becomes more complicated. In the simplest form, one network can be picked randomly or based on some criteria, and the streaming client solely uses that network. In another form, multiple networks can be simultaneously used by the streaming client and due to the aggregation, doing so may deliver better and more stable quality, and at a lower latency than using either of the networks individually. However, using multiple networks simultaneously is not trivial in certain scenarios. In this demo, we present a gateway-based solution where the gateway is connected to two different networks and dynamically decides which network(s) to use for streaming while hiding all the decision complexity from the streaming clients behind it. In other words, our solution is transparent to the streaming clients, which means any existing client can benefit from this solution without any changes.},

Stallion uses a sliding window to measure the mean and standard deviation of both the bandwidth and latency.

	abstract = {Recently, HTTP has been widely used for the delivery of real-time multimedia content over the Internet, such as in video streaming applications. To combat the varying network resources of the Internet, rate adaptation is used to adapt the transmission rate to the varying network capacity. A key research problem of rate adaptation is to identify network congestion early enough and to probe the spare network capacity. In adaptive HTTP streaming, this problem becomes challenging because of the difficulties in differentiating between the short-term throughput variations, incurred by the TCP congestion control, and the throughput changes due to more persistent bandwidth changes.In this paper, we propose a novel rate adaptation algorithm for adaptive HTTP streaming that detects bandwidth changes using a smoothed HTTP throughput measured based on the segment fetch time (SFT). The smoothed HTTP throughput instead of the instantaneous TCP transmission rate is used to determine if the bitrate of the current media matches the end-to-end network bandwidth capacity. Based on the smoothed throughput measurement, this paper presents a receiver-driven rate adaptation method for HTTP/TCP streaming that deploys a step-wise increase/ aggressive decrease method to switch up/down between the different representations of the content that are encoded at different bitrates. Our rate adaptation method does not require any transport layer information such as round trip time (RTT) and packet loss rates which are available at the TCP layer. Simulation results show that the proposed rate adaptation algorithm quickly adapts to match the end-to-end network capacity and also effectively controls buffer underflow and overflow.},

	abstract = {Changing network conditions pose severe problems to video streaming in the Internet. HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) is a technology employed by numerous video services that relieves these issues by adapting the video to the current network conditions. It enables service providers to improve resource utilization and Quality of Experience (QoE) by incorporating information from different layers in order to deliver and adapt a video in its best possible quality. Thereby, it allows taking into account end user device capabilities, available video quality levels, current network conditions, and current server load. For end users, the major benefits of HAS compared to classical HTTP video streaming are reduced interruptions of the video playback and higher bandwidth utilization, which both generally result in a higher QoE. Adaptation is possible by changing the frame rate, resolution, or quantization of the video, which can be done with various adaptation strategies and related client- and server-side actions. The technical development of HAS, existing open standardized solutions, but also proprietary solutions are reviewed in this paper as fundamental to derive the QoE influence factors that emerge as a result of adaptation. The main contribution is a comprehensive survey of QoE related works from human computer interaction and networking domains, which are structured according to the QoE impact of video adaptation. To be more precise, subjective studies that cover QoE aspects of adaptation dimensions and strategies are revisited. As a result, QoE influence factors of HAS and corresponding QoE models are identified, but also open issues and conflicting results are discussed. Furthermore, technical influence factors, which are often ignored in the context of HAS, affect perceptual QoE influence factors and are consequently analyzed. This survey gives the reader an overview of the current state of the art and recent developments. At the same time, it targets networking researchers who develop new solutions for HTTP video streaming or assess video streaming from a user centric point of view. Therefore, this paper is a major step toward truly improving HAS.},

	abstract = {Dynamic adaptive HTTP (DASH) based streaming is steadily becoming the most popular online video streaming technique. DASH streaming provides seamless playback by adapting the video quality to the network conditions during the video playback. A DASH server supports adaptive streaming by hosting multiple representations of the video and each representation is divided into small segments of equal playback duration. At the client end, the video player uses an adaptive bitrate selection (ABR) algorithm to decide the bitrate to be selected for each segment depending on the current network conditions. Currently, proposed ABR algorithms ignore the fact that the segment sizes significantly vary for a given video bitrate. Due to this, even though an ABR algorithm is able to measure the network bandwidth, it may fail to predict the time to download the next segment In this paper, we propose a segment-aware rate adaptation (SARA) algorithm that considers the segment size variation in addition to the estimated path bandwidth and the current buffer occupancy to accurately predict the time required to download the next segment We also developed an open source Python based emulated DASH video player, that was used to compare the performance of SARA and a basic ABR. Our results show that SARA provides a significant gain over the basic algorithm in the video quality delivered, without noticeably impacting the video switching rates.},

Past measurement studies have identified issues with today's commercial players with respect to three key metrics---efficiency, fairness, and stability---when multiple bitrate-adaptive players share a bottleneck link. Unfortunately, our current understanding of why these effects occur and how they can be mitigated is quite limited.In this paper, we present a principled understanding of bitrate adaptation and analyze several commercial players through the lens of an abstract player model. Through this framework, we identify the root causes of several undesirable interactions that arise as a consequence of overlaying the video bitrate adaptation over HTTP. Building on these insights, we develop a suite of techniques that can systematically guide the tradeoffs between stability, fairness and efficiency and thus lead to a general framework for robust video adaptation. We pick one concrete instance from this design space and show that it significantly outperforms today's commercial players on all three key metrics across a range of experimental scenarios.},

	abstract = {HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) is quickly becoming the de facto standard for Over-The-Top video streaming. In HAS, each video is temporally segmented and stored in different quality levels. Quality selection heuristics, deployed at the video player, allow dynamically requesting the most appropriate quality level based on the current network conditions. Today's heuristics are deterministic and static, and thus not able to perform well under highly dynamic network conditions. Moreover, in a multi-client scenario, issues concerning fairness among clients arise, meaning that different clients negatively influence each other as they compete for the same bandwidth. In this article, we propose a Reinforcement Learning-based quality selection algorithm able to achieve fairness in a multi-client setting. A key element of this approach is a coordination proxy in charge of facilitating the coordination among clients. The strength of this approach is three-fold. First, the algorithm is able to learn and adapt its policy depending on network conditions, unlike current HAS heuristics. Second, fairness is achieved without explicit communication among agents and thus no significant overhead is introduced into the network. Third, no modifications to the standard HAS architecture are required. By evaluating this novel approach through simulations, under mutable network conditions and in several multi-client scenarios, we are able to show how the proposed approach can improve system fairness up to 60{\%} compared to current HAS heuristics.},

	abstract = {Internet video makes up a significant part of the Internet traffic and its fraction is constantly growing. In order to guarantee best user experience throughout different network access technologies with dynamically varying network conditions, it is fundamental to adopt technologies enabling a proper delivery of the media content. One of such technologies is adaptive streaming. It allows to dynamically adapt the bit-rate of the stream to varying network conditions. There are various approaches to adaptive streaming. In our work, we focus on the receiver-driven approach where the media file is subdivided into segments, each of the segments is provided at multiple bit-rates, and the task of the client is to select the appropriate bit-rate for each of the segments. With this approach, the challenges are (i) to properly estimate the dynamics of the available network throughput, (ii) to control the filling level of the client buffer in order to avoid underflows resulting in playback interruptions, (iii) to maximize the quality of the stream, while avoiding unnecessary quality fluctuations, and, finally, (iv) to minimize the delay between the user's request and the start of the playback. During our work, we designed and implemented a receiver-driven adaptation algorithm for adaptive streaming that does not rely on cross-layer information or server assistance. We integrated the algorithm with a prototype implementation of a streaming client based on the MPEG DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) standard. We evaluated the implemented prototype in real-world scenarios and found that it performes remarkably well even under challenging network conditions. Further, it exhibits stable and fair operation if a common link is shared among multiple clients.},

As a result, rate selection based on inaccurate estimates can trigger a feedback loop, leading to undesirably variable and low-quality video.

We show that client-side buffered video time is a good feedback signal to guide video adaptation. We then propose novel video rate control algorithms that balance the needs for video rate smoothness and high bandwidth utilization. We show that a small video rate margin can lead to much improved smoothness in video rate and buffer size. The proposed DASH designs are also extended to work with multiple CDN servers. We develop a fully-functional DASH system and evaluate its performance through extensive experiments on a network testbed and the Internet.

Although there are some efforts to standardize media representation for this technology, adaptation techniques remain an open area for development. Recently, an alarm was raised by a study about the interaction between TCP congestion control algorithms and large buffers on the Internet. Queuing delays when these buffers are full can reach several hundreds of milliseconds in a phenomenon that was dubbed buffer bloat. In this paper we use measurements on a testbed to demonstrate and quantify the buffer bloat effect of HTTP adaptive streaming. We show that in a typical residential setting a single video stream can easily cause queuing delays up to one second and even more hence seriously degrading the performance of other applications sharing the home network. We develop SABRE (Smooth Adaptive Bit RatE), a scheme that can be implemented by the client to mitigate this problem. We implemented SABRE in the VLC player. Using our testbed, we show that our technique can reduce buffer occupancy and significantly diminish the buffer bloat effect without affecting the experience of the video viewer.},

Many studies have shown that current solutions perform suboptimally, and despite the proliferation of several proposals in this space, both from commercial providers and researchers, there is still a distinct lack of clarity and consensus w.r.t. several natural questions: (1) What objectives does/should such an algorithm optimize?

(3) How sensitive is an algorithm to operating conditions (e.g., bandwidth stability, buffer size, available bitrates)?

However, it is still a challenge to play back video smoothly with high quality in the time-varying Internet. In this paper, we propose a buffer based rate adaptation scheme, which is able to smooth bandwidth variations and provide a continuous video playback. Through analysis, we show that simply preventing buffer underflow/overflow in the greedy rate adaptation method may incur serious rate oscillations, which is poor quality-of-experience for users. To improve it, we present a novel control-theoretic approach to control buffering size and rate adaptation. We modify the buffered video time model by adding two thresholds: an overflow threshold and an underflow threshold, to filter the effect of short-term network bandwidth variations while keeping playback smooth. However, the modified rate adaptation system is nonlinear. By choosing operating point properly, we linearize the rate control system. By a Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller, we are able to adapt video rate with high responsiveness and stability. We carefully design the parameters for the PD controller. Moreover, we show that reserving a small positive/negative bandwidth margin can greatly decrease the opportunities of buffer underflow/overflow incurred by the bandwidth prediction error. At last, we demonstrate that our proposed control-theoretic approach are highly efficient through real network trace.},

@article{140405,
	abstract = {Today, the technology for video streaming over the Internet is converging towards a paradigm named HTTP-based adaptive streaming (HAS), which brings two new features. First, by using HTTP/TCP, it leverages network-friendly TCP to achieve both firewall/NAT traversal and bandwidth sharing. Second, by pre-encoding and storing the video in a number of discrete rate levels, it introduces video bitrate adaptivity in a scalable way so that the video encoding is excluded from the closed-loop adaptation. A conventional wisdom in HAS design is that since the TCP throughput observed by a client would indicate the available network bandwidth, it could be used as a reliable reference for video bitrate selection. We argue that this is no longer true when HAS becomes a substantial fraction of the total network traffic. We show that when multiple HAS clients compete at a network bottleneck, the discrete nature of the video bitrates results in difficulty for a client to correctly perceive its fair-share bandwidth. Through analysis and test bed experiments, we demonstrate that this fundamental limitation leads to video bitrate oscillation and other undesirable behaviors that negatively impact the video viewing experience. We therefore argue that it is necessary to design at the application layer using a "probe and adapt" principle for video bitrate adaptation (where "probe" refers to trial increment of the data rate, instead of sending auxiliary piggybacking traffic), which is akin, but also orthogonal to the transport-layer TCP congestion control. We present PANDA - a client-side rate adaptation algorithm for HAS - as a practical embodiment of this principle. Our test bed results show that compared to conventional algorithms, PANDA is able to reduce the instability of video bitrate selection by over 75{\%} without increasing the risk of buffer underrun.},

Among the techniques employed to implement video adaptivity, the stream-switching over HTTP is getting a wide acceptance due to its deployment and implementation simplicity. Recently it has been shown that the client-side algorithms proposed so far generate an on-off traffic pattern that may lead to unfairness and underutilization when many video flows share a bottleneck. In this paper we propose ELASTIC (fEedback Linearization Adaptive STreamIng Controller), a client-side controller designed using feedback control theory that does not generate an on-off traffic pattern. By employing a controlled testbed, allowing bandwidth capacity and delays to be set, we compare ELASTIC with other client-side controllers proposed in the literature. In particular, we have checked to what extent the considered algorithms are able to: 1) fully utilize the bottleneck, 2) fairly share the bottleneck, 3) obtain a fair share when TCP greedy flows share the bottleneck with video flows. The obtained results show that ELASTIC achieves a very high fairness and is able to get the fair share when coexisting with TCP greedy flows.},

Here, we present D-DASH, a framework that combines deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques to optimize the quality of experience (QoE) of DASH. Different learning architectures are proposed and assessed, combining feed-forward and recurrent deep neural networks with advanced strategies. D-DASH designs are thoroughly evaluated against prominent algorithms from the state-of-the-art, both heuristic and learning-based, evaluating performance indicators such as image quality across video segments and freezing/rebuffering events. Our numerical results are obtained on real and simulated channel traces and show the superiority of D-DASH in nearly all the considered quality metrics. Besides yielding a considerably higher QoE, the D-DASH framework exhibits faster convergence to the rate-selection strategy than the other learning algorithms considered in the study. This makes it possible to shorten the training phase, making D-DASH a good candidate for client-side runtime learning.},

However, this may waste energy and bandwidth if the user skips or quits before the end of the video. Using a small buffer can reduce the bandwidth wastage, but may consume more energy and introduce rebuffering delay. In this paper, we analyze the power consumption during video streaming considering user skip and early quit scenarios. We first propose an offline method to compute the minimum power consumption, and then introduce an online solution to save energy based on whether the user tends to watch video for a long time or tends to skip. We have implemented the online solution on Android based smartphones. Experimental results and trace-driven simulation results show that that our method can save energy while achieving a better tradeoff between delay and bandwidth compared to existing methods.},

Various adaptation schemes have been proposed to select the most suitable quality level during video playback. Adaptation schemes are currently based on the measured TCP throughput received by the video player. Although video buffer can mitigate throughput fluctuations, it does not take into account the effect of the transition of quality levels on the QoE.In this paper, we propose a QoE-aware DASH system (or QDASH) to improve the user-perceived quality of video watching. We integrate available bandwidth measurement into the video data probes with a measurement proxy architecture. We have found that our available bandwidth measurement method facilitates the selection of video quality levels. Moreover, we assess the QoE of the quality transitions by carrying out subjective experiments. Our results show that users prefer a gradual quality change between the best and worst quality levels, instead of an abrupt switching.

Can the player quickly converge to the maximum sustainable bitrate? Second, what happens when two adaptive video players compete for available bandwidth in the bottleneck link? Can they share the resources in a stable and fair manner? And third, how does adaptive streaming perform with live content? Is the player able to sustain a short playback delay?

	abstract = {HTTP video streaming, such as Flash video, is widely deployed to deliver stored media. Owing to TCP's reliable service, the picture and sound quality would not be degraded by network impairments, such as high delay and packet loss. However, the network impairments can cause rebuffering events which would result in jerky playback and deform the video's temporal structure. These quality degradations could adversely affect users' quality of experience (QoE). In this paper, we investigate the relationship among three levels of quality of service (QoS) of HTTP video streaming: network QoS, application QoS, and user QoS (i.e., QoE). Our ultimate goal is to understand how the network QoS affects the QoE of HTTP video streaming. Our approach is to first characterize the correlation between the application and network QoS using analytical models and empirical evaluation. The second step is to perform subjective experiments to evaluate the relationship between application QoS and QoE.

	abstract = {Given the impact of YouTube on Internet services and social networks, a healthy quantity of research has been conducted over the past few years. The majority of studies on traffic capture and evaluation were carried out prior to Google's acquisition of YouTube in 2007. Since then, there have been some changes made to the user policy and service infrastructure, including limits placed on video duration, file size, and resolution. This article depicts the latest YouTube traffic profiles and delivers updated and valuable information for future researchers. To obtain a detailed understanding of YouTube video characteristics, a customized Web spider was employed to crawl over a million YouTube videos. The study demonstrates consistency with previous research for major video streams while revealing that new categories of features have emerged within the YouTube service provision. Compared with traditional video repositories, YouTube exhibits many unique characteristics that could introduce novel challenges and opportunities for optimizing the performance of short video-sharing services.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a traffic characterization study of the popular video sharing service, YouTube. Over a three month period we observed almost 25 million transactions between users on an edge network and YouTube, including more than 600,000 video downloads. We also monitored the globally popular videos over this period of time.In the paper we examine usage patterns, file properties, popularity and referencing characteristics, and transfer behaviors of YouTube, and compare them to traditional Web and media streaming workload characteristics. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the implications of the observed characteristics. For example, we find that as with the traditional Web, caching could improve the end user experience, reduce network bandwidth consumption, and reduce the load on YouTube's core server infrastructure. Unlike traditional Web caching, Web 2.0 provides additional meta-data that should be exploited to improve the effectiveness of strategies like caching.},

	Internet video delivery. In this paper, we characterize how CDNs serve
	video content, and the implications for video performance, especially
	emerging 4K video streaming. Our work is based on measurements of
	multiple well known video publishers served by top CDNs. Our results
	show that (i) video chunks in a session often see heterogeneous behavior
	in terms of whether they hit in the CDN, and which layer they are served
	from; and (ii) application throughput can vary significantly even across
	chunks in a session based on where they are served from. The differences
	while sensitive to client location and CDN can sometimes be significant
	enough to impact the viability of 4K streaming. We consider the
	implications for Adaptive bit rate (ABR) algorithms given they rely on
	throughput prediction, and are agnostic to whether objects hit in the
	CDN and where. We evaluate the potential benefits of exposing where a
	video chunk is served from to the client ABR algorithm in the context of
	the widely studied model predictive control (MPC) algorithm. Emulation
	experiments show the approach has the potential to reduce prediction

	abstract = {Adaptive bitrate streaming (ABR) has become the de facto
	technique for video streaming over the Internet. Despite a flurry of
	techniques, achieving high quality ABR streaming over cellular networks
	remains a tremendous challenge. ABR streaming can be naturally modeled
	as a feedback control problem. There has been some initial work on using
	PID, a widely used feedback control technique, for ABR streaming.
	Existing studies, however, either use PID control directly without fully
	considering the special requirements of ABR streaming, leading to
	suboptimal results, or conclude that PID is not a suitable approach. In
	this paper, we take a fresh look at PID-based control for ABR streaming.
	We design a framework called PIA that strategically leverages PID
	control concepts and incorporates several novel strategies to account
	for the various requirements of ABR streaming. We evaluate PIA using
	simulation based on real LTE network traces, as well as using real DASH
	implementation. The results demonstrate that PIA outperforms
	state-of-the-art schemes in providing high average bitrate with
	significantly lower bitrate changes (reduction up to 40{\%}) and stalls
	(reduction up to 85{\%}), while incurring very small runtime overhead.},

	abstract = {HTTP video streaming, employed by most of the video-sharing websites, allows users to control the video playback using, for example, pausing and switching the bit rate. These user-viewing activities can be used to mitigate the temporal structure impairments of the video quality. On the other hand, other activities, such as mouse movement, do not help reduce the impairment level. In this paper, we have performed subjective experiments to analyze user-viewing activities and correlate them with network path performance and user quality of experience. The results show that network measurement alone may miss important information about user dissatisfaction with the video quality. Moreover, video impairments can trigger user-viewing activities, notably pausing and reducing the screen size. By including the pause events into the prediction model, we can increase its explanatory power.},

	abstract = {Combining the concepts of caching and transmission control protocol (TCP)-friendly streaming of layer-encoded video bears the problem that those videos might not be cached in full quality. Therefore, we focus in this work on the scheduling of retransmissions of missing segments of a cached video in a manner that allows clients to receive the content in an improved quality. In a first step, we conducted subjective assessments of variations in layer-encoded video with the goal to validate existing quality metrics, including our own, which are based on certain assumptions. A statistical analysis of the subjective assessment validates these assumptions. We also show that the frequently used peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) is not an appropriate metric for variations in layer-encoded video. With the insight from the subjective assessment we develop heuristics for retransmission scheduling and prove their applicability by conducting a series of simulations.},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen a rapidly increasing traffic demand for HTTP-based high-quality live video streaming. The surging traffic demand, as well as the real-time property of live videos, make it challenging for content delivery networks (CDNs) to guarantee the Quality-of-Experiences (QoE) of viewers. The initial video segment (IVS) of live streaming plays an important role in the QoE of live viewers, particularly when users require fast join time and smooth view experience. State-of-the-art research on this regard estimates network throughput for each viewer and thus may incur a large overhead that offsets the benefit. To tackle the problem, we propose Rldish, a scheme deployed at the edge CDN server, to dynamically select a suitable IVS for new live viewers based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). Rldish is transparent to both the client and the streaming server. It collects the real-time QoE observations from the edge without any client-side assistance, then uses these QoE observations as real-time rewards in RL. We deploy Rldish as a virtualized network function (VNF) in a real HTTP cache server, and evaluate its performance using streaming servers distributed over the world. Our experiments show that Rldish improves the state- of-the-art IVS selection scheme w.r.t. the average QoE of live viewers by up to 22{\%}.},
